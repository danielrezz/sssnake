    Summary
</h2>

<p>
    Here is the classic Snake game that I wanted to learn how to make for some Javascript practice. I followed along with a Youtube video on how to set the game up using vanilla Javascript. Once that was complete, I put a little bit of my own spin on it.

    As soon as you load up the page, you will see the game board and score counter. As soon as you press an arrow key, the exciting, retro-style music begins and your snake takes off. Collect as many golden berries as you can to achieve a high score!

    Challenges

    I had a lot of fun making this and learned a lot along the way. One thing that I learned was how to use the library p5.js. It was perfect for my need to implement custom sounds and music specifically created for this project. It took quite a bit of troubleshooting to get things to start when a key is pressed or to get my sounds to play at the appropriate volume.
  
  Another challenge was implementing my own Javascript for the start text and score counter. Although these are simple concepts, I felt that I proved to myself that I am a programmer and have gained skills on how to successfully accomplish any desired functionality using JS. It is very exciting to me!
